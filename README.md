# Haskell

Download stack and run "stack runghc src/Main.hs" to see this slow neuralnetwork attempt
to learn to recognize the number three represented in a 3x5 matrix. 

This is not supposed to be used for anything actually useful.. cause in it's current state
this network's learning is quite slow. This was mainly made to educate myself about neural-networks.
